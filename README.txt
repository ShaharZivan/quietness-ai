Quietness.ai — Vite + React (JSX) + Tailwind starter

Files you provide:
  - src/quiet.jsx   <-- Put your Quietness.ai page here (default export)

Commands:
  npm install
  npm run dev

Notes:
  - Path alias '@' points to 'src', so '@/components/ui/button' resolves to 'src/components/ui/button.jsx'
  - Minimal UI components are included to satisfy imports from your page.
  - Tailwind is pre-wired. Edit tailwind.config.js if you change paths.
